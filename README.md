The Wardrobe App is a personal clothing and outfit tracker and idea book. Users can add clothing items, and use those items to build outfits, which they can store in their digital wardrobe to help build their style.
When a user is signed out, they can login or register, as well as view and search through all public outfits. When a user clicks an outfit, they can see the individual pieces of clothing, which are links to buy the item online. They can also view comments that registered users have made on outfits.
As a signed in user, you can view and comment on public outfits, add items, view your added items, add outfits, and view your added outfits. Users also have a privacy toggle, so that they will only show up under their outfits, and not shared in the public outfits pool.
Admin users have access to the admin console, which allows them to see a list of all users, and the access to delete users items.
